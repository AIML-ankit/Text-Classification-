# Text-Classification-
This Project is for Natural Language Processing, especially for classification. 

Task - 
   1- Read The date and create the Data Frame. (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reading-writing-text-files-python/)
   
   2- Text Cleanup - Text Normalization, Special Character removal, Hyperlink removal, stemming and lemmatization. 
       1- Re- Text cleanup. ('https://towardsdatascience.com/cleaning-text-data-with-python-b69b47b97b76')
       2- NTTK, Spacy - stemming and lemmatization.('https://towardsdatascience.com/text-normalization-with-spacy-and-nltk-1302ff430119')
       
   3- Tokenization and Embedding- Convert text to numbers and embedding.
       1- Tokenization- NLTK, Tensorflow 'https://www.tensorflow.org/text/guide/tokenizers'
       2- Embedding- Word2Vec and Glove. 'https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-word2vec/' 
       
   3- Visualize Data- Visualize most common words, frequency of word. length of text, distribution on text and data balance. 
       1- Matplotlib
       2- Word cloud- 'https://betterprogramming.pub/create-custom-word-clouds-in-python-841563933e73'
       
   3- Matrix for Performance -  
      1- Accuracy- 'https://towardsdatascience.com/the-5-classification-evaluation-metrics-you-must-know-aa97784ff226'
      2- Confusion Matrix - 
      
   5- Model Building - 
      1- Logistic Regression-
      2- Naive Byes. 
      3- <WE WILL ADD MORE IN FUTURE>
